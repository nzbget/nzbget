# From this point forward, I strongly encourage folks to treat [nzbgetcom/nzbget](https://github.com/nzbgetcom/nzbget) as the 'official' repo.

I've been keeping nzbget-ng/nzbget on life-support for over a year, since @hugbug archived the original nzbget/nzbget repo, and all the fallout that caused.

I've been very upfront - I knew from the outset that my time was painfully limited, and I didn't have all the skills to develop and test every OS and configuration combination out there. My goal was to prevent its 'death' from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy, long enough to either attract some help or pass on the baton.

The arrival of the [nzbgetcom/nzbget](https://github.com/nzbgetcom/nzbget) project has caused some confusion, and even some speculation that there was some sort of competition or rivalry going on. Nothing further from the truth - that's simply not the culture that underpins open source. It's just that we hadn't struck up a conversation until this past week. We've now had a handful of exchanges, every one of them positive.

In short, [nzbgetcom/nzbget](https://github.com/nzbgetcom/nzbget) already incorporates some of the improvements from nzbget-ng.

If you have made a pull request to nzbget-ng/nzbget in the past year, it will make life easier for everyone if you do so again against nzbgetcom/nzbget. While I'm planning to move whatever has value in nzbget-ng/nzbget over to nzbgetcom/nzbget, I don't have a timeline, and as I've said before, only have limited time to devote to this.

If you don't already, I encourage you to monitor the [nzbget subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nzbget/) on reddit.com for news and updates.

# Background

I kinda 'fell into' maintaining nzbget because I'd made the most recent pull request at the time (before the repo was archived). I then realized it wasn't going to be merged when u/hugbug archived it on github. So I pulled the other pending pull requests into my fork, and started trying to dispel the public notion that the project was 'dead' (Q: how can a popular open source project with >170 forks and thousands of stars ever be 'dead'?).

Things like the auto-software-update process breaking, and the [nzbget.net](https://nzbget.net) forums being broken, certainly reinforced that assumption. Linuxserver.io's decision to drop their popular nzbget docker image just fueled the fire.

There was (and continues to be) a very active community of nzbget users. However, I did not see anyone step into the breach to maintain it. While I had questions about how effective a maintainer I could be, given everything else going on in my life, I also refused to see it die because I wasn't willing to try.

To be clear, it was @hugbug's prerogative to move on; he put far more effort into it over a longer period of time than any of us had a right to expect. I thank him for the gift he gave us, wish him well, and hope his decision wasn't forced by some unfortunate life event.
