nzbget-0.3.0:
  - The download queue now contains newsgroup-files to be downloaded instead of 
    nzb-jobs. By adding a new job, the nzb-file is immediately parsed and each 
    newsgroup-file is added to download queue. Each file can therefore be 
    managed separately (paused, deleted or moved);
  - Current queue state is saved after every change (file is completed or the 
    queue is changed - entries paused, deleted or moved). The state is saved on
    disk using internal format, which allows fast loading on next program start
    (no need to parse xml-files again);
  - The remaining download-size is updated after every article is completed to
    indicate the correct remaining size and time for total files in queue;
  - Downloaded articles, which are saved in temp-directory, can be reused on
    next program start, if the file was not completed (option "continuepartial"
    in config-file); 
  - Along with uulib the program has internal decoder for yEnc-format. This
    decoder was necessary, because uulib is so slow, that it prevents using of
    the program on not so powerful systems like linux-routers (MIPSEL CPU 200
    MHz). The new decoder is very fast. It is controlled over option "decoder" 
    in config-file;
  - The decoder can be completely disabled. In this case all downloaded articles
    are saved in unaltered form and can be joined with an external program;
    UUDeview is one of them;
  - If download of article fails, the program attempts to download it again so
    many times, what the option "retries" in config-file says. This works even
    if no servers with level higher than "0" defined. After each retry the next
    server-level is used, if there are no more levels, the program switches to
    level "0" again. The pause between retries can be set with config-option
    "retryinterval";
  - If despite of a stated connection-timeout (it can be changed via
    config-option "connectiontimeout") connection hangs, the program tries to
    cancel the connection (after "terminatetimeout" seconds). If it doesn't
    work the download thread is killed and the article will be redownloaded in
    a new thread. This ensures, that there are no long-time hanging connections
    and all articles are downloaded, when a time to rejoin file comes;
  - Automatic par-checking and repairing. Only reuired par-files are downloaded.
    The program uses libpar2 and does not require any external tools. The big
    advantage of library is, that it allows to continue par-check after new
    par-blocks were downloaded. This were not possible with external 
    par2cmdline-tool;
  - There is a daemon-mode now (command-line switch "-D" (--daemon)). In this
    mode a lock-file (default location "/tmp/nzbget.lock", can be changed via
    option "lockfile") contains PID of daemon;
  - The format of configuration-file was changed from xml to more common
    text-format. It allows also using of variables like 
    "tempdir=${MAINDIR}/tmp";
  - Any option of config-file can be overwritten via command-line switch
    "-o" (--option). This includes also the definition of servers. 
    This means that the program can now be started without a configuration-file 
    at all (all required options must be passed via command-line);
  - The command-line switches were revised. The dedicated switches to change
    options in config-file were eliminated, since any option can now be changed
    via switch "-o" (--option);
  - If the name of configuration-file was not passed via command-line the
    program search it  in following locations: "~/.nzbget", "/etc/nzbget.conf", 
    "/usr/etc/nzbget.conf", "/usr/local/etc/nzbget.conf", 
    "/opt/etc/nzbget.conf";
  - The new command-line switch "-n" (--noconfigfile) prevents the loading of
    a config-file. All required config-options must be passed via command-line
    (switch "-o" (--option));
  - To start the program in server mode either "-s" (--server) or 
    "-D" (--daemon) switch must be used. If the program started without any
    parameters it prints help-screen. There is no a dedicated switch to start
    in a standalone mode. If switches "-s" and "-D" are omitted and none of
    client-request-switches used the standalone mode is default. This usage
    of switches is more common to programs like "wget". To add a file to 
    server's download queue use switch "-A" (--append) and a name of nzb-file
    as last command-line parameter;
  - There is a new switch "-Q" (--quit) to gracefully stop server. BTW the
    SIGKIL-signal is now handled appropriately, so "killall nzbget" is also OK,
    where "killall -9 nzbget" terminates server immediately (helpful if it
    hangs, but it shouldn't);
  - With new switch "-T" (--top) the file will be added to the top of download
    queue. Use it with switch "-A" (--append);
  - The download queue can be edited via switch "-E" (--edit). It is possible
    to pause, unpause, delete and move files in queue. The IDs of file(s)
    to be affected are passed via switch "-I" (fileid), either one ID or a 
    range in a form "IDForm-IDTo". This also means, that every file in queue
    have ID now;
  - The switch "-L" (--list) prints IDs of files consequently. It prints also
    name, size, percentage of completing and state (paused or not) of each file. 
    Plus summary info: number of files, total remaining size and size of
    paused files, server state (paused or running), number of threads on 
    server, current speed limit;
  - With new switch "-G" (--log) the last N lines printed to server's 
    screen-log, can be printed on client. The max number of lines which can
    be returned from servers depends on option "logbuffersize";
  - The redesigned Frontends (known as outputmodes "loggable", "colored" and
    "curses") can connect to (remote) server and behave as if you were running
    server-instance of program itself (command-line switch "-C" (--connect)). 
    The log-output updates constantly and even all control-functions in 
    ncurses-mode works: pause/unpause server, set download rate limit, edit of
    queue (pause/unpause, delete, move entries). The number of connected 
    clients is not limited. The "outputmode" on a client can be set
    independently from server. The client-mode is especially useful if the
    server runs as a daemon;
  - The writing to log-file can be disabled via option "createlog". 
    The location of log-file controls the option "log-file";
  - Switch "-p" (--printconfig) prints the name of configuration file being
    used and all option/value-pairs, taking into account all used 
    "-o" (--option) - switches;
  - The communication protocol between server and client was optimized to
    minimize the size of transferred data. Instead of fixing the size for
    Filenames in data-structures to 512 bytes only in fact used data
    are transferred;
  - Extensions in ncurses-outputmode: scrolling in queue-list works better, 
    navigation in queue with keys Up, Down, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End. 
    Keys to move entries are "U" (move up), "N" (move down), "T" (move to top),
    "B" (move to bottom). "P" to pause/unpause file. The size, percentage 
    of completing and state (paused or not) for every file is printed. 
    The header of queue shows number of total files, number of unpaused 
    files and size for all and unpaused files. Better using of screen estate
    space – no more empty lines and separate header for status (total seven
    lines gain). The messages are printed on several lines (if they not fill
    in one line) without trimming now;
  - configure.ac-file updated to work with recent versions of autoconf/automake. 
    There are new configure-options now: "--disable-uulib" to compile the 
    program without uulib; "--disable-ncurses" to disable ncurses-support 
    (eliminates necessity of ncurses-libs), useful on embedded systems with 
    little resources; "--disable-parcheck" to compile without par-check;
  - The algorithm for parsing of nzb-files now uses XMLReader instead of 
    DOM-Parser to minimize memory usage (no mor needs to build complete DOM-tree
    in memory). Thanks to Thierry MERLE <merlum@users.sourceforge.net> for 
    the patch;
  - The log-file contains now thread-ID for all entry-types and additionally 
    for debug-entries: filename, line number and function's name of source
    code, where the message was printed. Debug-messages can be disabled in 
    config-file (option "debugtarget") like other messages;
  - The program is now compatible with windows. Project file for MS Visual 
    C++ 2005 is included. Use "nzbget -install" and "nzbget -remove" to
    install/remove NZBGet-Service. Servers and clients can run on diferrent
    operating systems;
  - Improved compatibility with POSIX systems; Tested on:
	  - Linux Debian 3.1 on x86;
	  - Linux BusyBox with uClibc on MIPSEL;
	  - PC-BSD 1.4 (based on FreeBSD 6.2) on x86;
	  - Solaris 10 on x86;
  - Many memory-leaks and thread issues were fixed;
  - The program was thoroughly worked over. Almost every line of code was
    revised;
