# Sample configuration file for nzbget
# Put this file to one of the following locations:
# ~/.nzbget
# /etc/nzbget.conf
# /usr/etc/nzbget.conf
# /usr/local/etc/nzbget.conf
# /opt/etc/nzbget.conf

# For quick start change the option MAINDIR and configure one news-server
# See section NEWS-SERVERS.


# PROGRAM OPTIONS

# Root directory for all related tasks
# MAINDIR is a variable and therefore starts with "$"
# The value "~/download" is example for POSIX. On Windows use 
# absolute paths, like "C:\Download".
$MAINDIR=~/download

# Destination-directory to store the downloaded files
destdir=${MAINDIR}/dst

# Directory to store download queue
queuedir=${MAINDIR}/queue

# Directory to monitor for incoming nzb-jobs
nzbdir=${MAINDIR}/nzb

# Directory to store temporary files
tempdir=${MAINDIR}/tmp

# Lock-file for daemon-mode, contains process-id (PID)
lockfile=/tmp/nzbget.lock

# User name for daemon-mode (UNIX in daemon-mode only).
# Set the user that the daemon normally runs at.
# Set $MAINDIR with an absolute path to be sure where it will write.
# This allows nzbget daemon to be launched in rc.local (at boot), and
# download items as a specific user id.
# NOTE: This option has effect only if the program is started from root-account,
# otherwise it is ignored and the daemon runs under current user id.
daemonusername=root

# Where to store log file, if it needs to be created (see "createlog")
logfile=${destdir}/nzbget.log

# Save download queue to disk. This allows to reload it on next start (yes, no)
savequeue=yes

# Reload download queue on start, if it exists (yes, no)
reloadqueue=yes

# Create log file (yes, no)
createlog=yes

# Delete log file upon server start (only in server-mode) (yes, no)
resetlog=no

# How various messages must be printed (screen, log, both, none)
# Debug-messages can be only printed if the programm was compiled in 
# debug-mode: "./configure --enable-debug"
infotarget=both
warningtarget=both
errortarget=both
debugtarget=both

# Create subdirectory with nzb-filename in destination-directory (yes, no)
appendnzbdir=yes

# Set screen-outputmode (loggable, colored, curses)
outputmode=colored

# Check if the destination file already exists (yes, no)
# If the file exists it will not be added to queue.
# If "no" the file will be downloaded and renamed to "filename_duplicate1",
# no existing files are deleted or overwritten.
dupecheck=no

# Set the maximum download rate in KB/s, "0" means no speed control
downloadrate=0

# Visibly rename broken files on download appending "_broken" (yes, no)
renamebroken=no

# Create a log of all broken files (yes ,no)
# It is a text file placed near downloaded files, which contains
# the names of broken files
createbrokenlog=yes

# Set the IP on which the server listen and which client uses to contact the server
# It could be ip-address oder dns-hostname
serverip=127.0.0.1

# Set the port which the server & client use
serverport=6789

# Set the password needed to succesfully queue a request
serverpassword=tegbzn6789

# Determine how the articles should be decoded (uulib, yenc, none)
# uulib - use uulib to decode files. Supports many encoding formats, but is slow.
# yenc - use internal yEnc-Decoder. Supports only yEnc-format and is very fast.
# none - the articles will not be decoded and joined. External programs 
# ("uudeview" is one of them) could be used to decode an join downloaded articles.
decoder=yEnc

# How much retries should be attempted if a download error occurs
retries=4

# Set the interval between retries, in seconds
retryinterval=10

# Set connection timeout, in seconds
connectiontimeout=60

# Timeout until a download-thread is killed (helps on hanging downloads), in seconds
terminatetimeout=600

# How many par2-files to load (none, all, one)
# none - all added par2-files must be automatically paused
# all - all added par2-files must be downloaded
# one - only one main par2-file must be dowloaded and other must be paused
# Paused files remain in queue and should be deleted manually,
# when they not needed anymore
loadpars=all

# Automatic par-verification (yes, no)
# To download only needed par2-files (smart par-files loading) set also 
# the option "loadpars" to "one". If option "loadpars" is set to "all",
# all par2-files will be downloaded before verification and repair starts.
# The option "renamebroken" must be set to "no", otherwise the par-checker
# may not find renamed files and failed.
parcheck=no

# Automatic par-repair (yes, no)
# If option "parcheck" is enabled and "parrepair" is not, the program
# only verifies downloaded files and downloads needed par2-files, but do
# not start repair-process. This is useful if the server does not have
# enough CPU power, since repairing of large files may take too much
# resources and time on a slow computers.
# This option has effect only if the option "parcheck" is enabled.
parrepair=yes

# Use only par2-files with matching names (yes, no)
# If par-check needs extra par-blocks it searches a par2-files
# in download queue, which can be unpauseed and used for restore. These par2-files
# should have the same base name as a main par2-file, currently loaded in par-checker.
# Sometimes extra par files (especially if they were uploaded not from original poster)
# have not matching names. Normally par-checker does not use these files, but
# you can allow it to use these file by setting "strictparname" to "no".
# This has however a side effect: if NZB-file contains more than one collection
# of files (with different par-sets), par-checker may download par-files from
# a wrong collection. This increases you traffic (but not harm par-check).
# NOTE: par-checker always uses only par-files added from the same NZB-file.
# Option "strictparname" does not change this behavior.
strictparname=yes

# Set path to program, that must be executed after the download of
# nzb-file or one collection in nzb-file (if par-check enabled)
# is completed and possibly par-checked/repaired.
# Six arguments are being passed to this program:
#  - path to destination dir, where downloaded files are located;
#  - name of nzb-file processed;
#  - name of par-file processed (if par-checked) or empty string (if not);
#  - result of par-check:
#      0 - not checked: par-check disabled or nzb-file does not contain any par-files;
#      1 - checked and failed to repair;
#      2 - checked and sucessfully repaired;
#      3 - checked and can be repaired but repair is disabled;
#  - state of nzb-job:
#      0 - there are more collections in this nzb-file queued;
#      1 - this was the last collection in nzb-file;
# NOTE: if par-check is enabled and nzb-file contains more than one collection
# of files the postprocess-program is called after each collection is completed
# and par-checked. If you want to clean up the directory (delete par-files, etc.)
# there are two possibilities, when you can do this:
#  1) you parse the "name of par-file processed" to find out the base name
#     of collection and clean up only files from this collection;
#  2) or you just check the parameter "state of nzb-job" and do clean up,
#     only if it is equal to "1" (which means, that this was the last
#     collection in nzb-file and all files are now completed);
# NOTE: do not forget to uncomment next line.
#postprocess=~/myscript.sh


# NEWS-SERVERS

# This section defines which servers nzbget should connect to.
# The servers will be ordered by their level, i.e. nzbget will at
# first try to download an article from the level-0-server.
# If that server fails, nzbget proceeds with the level-1-server, etc.
# A good idea is surely to put your major download-server at level 0
# and your fill-servers at levels 1,2,...
# NOTE 1: Do not leave out a level in your server-list and start with level 0!
# NOTE 2: Several servers with the same level may be used.

# First server, on level 0
# Level of newsserver
server1.level=0
# Host-name of newsserver
server1.host=my1.newsserver.com
# Port to connect to (default 119 if not specified)
server1.port=119
# Username to use for authentication
server1.username=user
# Password to use for authentication
server1.password=pass
# Maximal number of simultaneous connections to this server
server1.connections=4

# Second server, on level 0
#server2.level=0
#server2.host=my2.newsserver.com
#server2.port=119
#server2.username=me
#server2.password=mypass
#server2.connections=4

# Third server, on level 1
#server3.level=1
#server3.host=fills.newsserver.com
#server3.port=119
#server3.username=me2
#server3.password=mypass2
#server3.connections=1
