# How old nzb-file should at least be for it to be loaded to queue, in seconds.
# Nzbget checks if nzb-file was not modified in last few seconds, defined by

# were not yet completely saved to disk, for example if they are still being
# downloaded in web-browser.
NzbDirFileAge=60

# Check for duplicate files (yes, no)
# If this option is enabled the program checks by adding of a new nzb-file:
# 1) if nzb-file contains duplicate entries. This check aims on detecting
#    of reposted files (if first file was not fully uploaded);    
#    If the program find two files with identical names, only the 
#    biggest of these files will be added to queue;
# 2) if download queue already contains file with the same name;
# 3) if destination file on disk already exists.
# In last two cases: if the file exists it will not be added to queue;
# If this option is disabled, all files are downloaded and duplicate files 
# are renamed to "filename_duplicate1".
# Existing files are never deleted or overwritten.
DupeCheck=no

# Visibly rename broken files on download appending "_broken" (yes, no)
# Do not activate this option if par-check is enabled.
RenameBroken=no

# Decode articles (yes, no)
# yes - decode articles using internal decoder (supports yEnc and UU formats).
# no - the articles will not be decoded and joined. External programs 
#      (like "uudeview") can be used to decode and join downloaded articles.
#      Also useful for debugging to look at article's source text.
Decode=yes

# Write decoded articles directly into destination output file (yes, no)
# With this option enabled the program at first creates the output 
# destination file with required size (total size of all articles), 
# then writes on the fly decoded articles directly to the file 
# without creating of any temporary files, even for decoded articles.
# This may results in major performance improvement, but this higly 
# depends on OS and filesystem used.
# Can improve performance on a very fast internet connections, 
# but you need to test if it works in your case.
# INFO: Tests showed, that on Linux with EXT3-partition activating of 
# this option results in up to 20% better performance, but on Windows with NTFS 
# or Linux with FAT32-partitions the performance were decreased. 
# The possible reason is that on EXT3-partition Linux can create large files
# very fast (if the content of file does not need to be initialized), 
# but Windows on NTFS-partition and also Linux on FAT32-partition need to
# initialize created large file with nulls, resulting in a big performace 
# degradation.
# NOTE: for testing try to download few big files (with total size 500-1000MB)
# and measure required time. Do not rely on the program's speed indicator.
# NOTE: if both options "DirectWrite" and "ContinuePartial" are enabled,
# the program will create empty articles-files in temp-directrory. They
# are used to continue download of file on a next program start. To minimize
# disk-io it is recommended to disable option "ContinuePartial", if 
# "DirectWrite" is enabled. Especially on a fast connections (where you
# would want to activate "DirectWrite") it should not be a problem to 
# redownload the interrupted file.
DirectWrite=no

# Check CRC of downloaded and decoded articles (yes, no)
# Normally this option should be enabled for better detecting of download 
# errors. However checking of CRC needs about the same CPU time as 
# decoding of articles. On a fast connections with slow CPUs disabling of
# CPU-check may slightly improve performance (if CPU is a limiting factor).
CrcCheck=yes

# How much retries should be attempted if a download error occurs
Retries=4

# Set the interval between retries, in seconds
RetryInterval=10

# Redownload article if CRC-check fails (yes, no)
# Helps to minimize number of broken files, but may be effective 
# only if you have multiple download servers (even from the same provider
# but from different locations (e.g. europe, usa)).
# In any case the option increases your traffic.
# For slow connections loading of extra par-blocks may be more effective
# The option "CrcCheck" must be enabled for option "RetryOnCrcError" to work.
RetryOnCrcError=no

# Set connection timeout, in seconds
ConnectionTimeout=60

# Timeout until a download-thread is killed, in seconds
# This can help on hanging downloads, but is dangerous. 
# Do not use small values!
TerminateTimeout=600

# Set the (approximate) maximum number of allowed threads.
# Sometimes under certain circumstances the program may create way to many 
# download threads. Most of them are in wait-state. That is not bad,
# but threads are usually a limited resource. If a program creates to many
# of them, operating system may kill it. The option <ThreadLimit> prevents that.
# NOTE 1: the number of threads is not the same as the number of connections
# opened to NNTP-servers. Do not use the option <ThreadLimit> to limit the
# number of connections. Use the appropriate options <ServerX.Connections>
# instead.
# NOTE 2: the actual number of created threads can be slightly larger as
# defined by the option. Important threads may be created even if the
# number of threads is exceeded. The option prevents only the creation of
# additional download threads.
# NOTE 3: in most cases you should leave the default value "100" unchanged.
# However you may increase that value if you need more than 90 connections 
# (that's very unlikely) or decrease the value if the OS does not allow so 
# many threads. But the most OSes should not have problems with 100 threads.
ThreadLimit=100

# Set the maximum download rate in KB/s, "0" means no speed control
DownloadRate=0

# Set the size of memory buffer used by writing the articles, in Bytes.
# Bigger values decrease disk-io, but increase memory usage.
# Value "0" causes the OS-dependend default value to be used.
# With value "-1" (which means "max/auto") the program sets the size of 
# buffer according to the size of current article (typically less than 500K).
# NOTE: the value must be written in bytes, do not use postfixes "K" or "M".
# NOTE: to calculate the memory usage multiply WriteBufferSize by max number
# of connections, configured in section "NEWS-SERVERS".
# NOTE: typical article's size not exceed 500000 bytes, so using bigger values
# (like several megabytes) will just waste memory.
# NOTE: for desktop computers with large amount of memory value "-1" (max/auto)
# is recommended, but for computers with very low memory (routers, NAS)
# value "0" (default OS-dependend size) could be better alternative.
# NOTE: write-buffer is managed by OS (system libraries) and therefore 
# the effect of the option is highly OS-dependend.
WriteBufferSize=0

# Pause if disk space gets below this value, in MegaBytes.
# Value "0" disables the check.
# Only the disk space on the drive with "DestDir" is checked.
# The drive with "TempDir" is not checked.

# may not find renamed files and fail
ParCheck=no

# Automatic par-repair (yes, no)
# If option "parcheck" is enabled and "parrepair" is not, the program
# only verifies downloaded files and downloads needed par2-files, but do
# not start repair-process. This is useful if the server does not have
# enough CPU power, since repairing of large files may take too much
# resources and time on a slow computers.
# This option has effect only if the option "parcheck" is enabled
ParRepair=yes

# Use only par2-files with matching names (yes, no)
# If par-check needs extra par-blocks it searches for par2-files
# in download queue, which can be unpaused and used for restore. 
# These par2-files should have the same base name as the main par2-file, 
# currently loaded in par-checker. Sometimes extra par files (especially if 
# they were uploaded from a different poster) have not matching names. 
# Normally par-checker does not use these files, but you can allow it 
# to use these files by setting "strictparname" to "no".
# This has however a side effect: if NZB-file contains more than one collection
# of files (with different par-sets), par-checker may download par-files from
# a wrong collection. This increases you traffic (but not harm par-check).
# NOTE: par-checker always uses only par-files added from the same NZB-file
# and the option "strictparname" does not change this behavior
StrictParName=yes

# Cleanup download queue after successful check/repair (yes, no)
# Enable this option for automatic deletion of unneeded (paused) par-files 
# from download queue after successful check/repair.
# NOTE: before cleaning up the program checks if all paused files are par-files.
# If there are paused non-par-files (this means that you have paused them
# manually), the cleanup will be skipped for this collection.
ParCleanupQueue=yes

# Set path to program, that must be executed after the download of nzb-file 
# or one collection in nzb-file (if par-check enabled and nzb-file contains 
# multiple collections; see note below for the definition of "collection") 
# is completed and possibly par-checked/repaired.
# Arguments passed to that program:
#  1 - path to destination dir, where downloaded files are located;
#  2 - name of nzb-file processed;
#  3 - name of par-file processed (if par-checked) or empty string (if not);
#  4 - result of par-check:
#      0 - not checked: par-check disabled or nzb-file does not contain any
#          par-files;
#      1 - checked and failed to repair;
#      2 - checked and sucessfully repaired;
#      3 - checked and can be repaired but repair is disabled;
#  5 - state of nzb-job:
#      0 - there are more collections in this nzb-file queued;
#      1 - this was the last collection in nzb-file;
#  6 - indication of failed par-jobs for current nzb-file:
#      0 - no failed par-jobs;
#      1 - current par-job or any of the previous par-jobs for the
#          same nzb-files failed;
#  7 - category assigned to nzb-file (can be empty string).
#
# NOTE: The parameter "state of nzb-job" is very important and MUST be checked 
# even in the simplest scripts.
# If par-check is enabled and nzb-file contains more than one collection
# of files the postprocess-program is called after each collection is completed
# and par-checked. If you want to unpack files or clean up the directory 
# (delete par-files, etc.) there are two possibilities, when you can do this:
#  1) you parse the "name of par-file processed" to find out the base name
#     of collection and clean up only files from this collection (not reliable,
#     because par-files sometimes have different names than rar-files);
#  2) or you just check the parameters "state of nzb-job" and "indication of 
#     failed par-jobs" and do the processing, only if they are set to "1" 
#     (which means, that this was the last collection in nzb-file and all files 
#      are now completed) and to "0" (no failed par-jobs) respectively;
# NOTE 2: if the option "ParCheck" is disabled nzbget calls PostProcess
# only once, not after every collection, because the detection of collection
# is disabled in this case;
# NOTE 3: the term "collection" in the above description actually means 
# "par-set". To determine what "collections" are present in nzb-file nzbget 
# looks for par-sets. If any collection of files within nzb-file does 
# not have any par-files, this collection will not be detected.
# For example, for nzb-file containing three collections but only two par-sets, 
# the postprocess will be called two times - after processing of each par-set.
# NOTE 4: do not forget to uncomment the next line
#PostProcess=~/myscript.sh

# Allow multiple post-processing for the same nzb-file (yes,no)
# After the post-processing (par-check and call of a postprocess-script) is
# completed, nzbget adds the nzb-file to a list of completed-jobs. The nzb-file
# stays in the list until the last file from that nzb-file is deleted from 
# the download queue (it occurs straight away if the par-check was successful 
# and the option "ParCleanupQueue" was set).
# So, if there were paused files in queue and they will be unpaused (manually
# or from a post-process-script) nzbget will not post-process nzb-file again.
# This prevents the unwanted multiple post-processing of the same nzb-file.
# But it might be needed if the par-check/-repair are performed not directly 
# by nzbget but from a post-process-script.
# NOTE 1: it is recommended to keep the option disabled. You should enable it
# only if it is suggested by a post-process-script's author.
# NOTE 2: by enabling "AllowReProcess" you should disable the option "ParCheck"
# to prevent multiple par-checking.
AllowReProcess=no

# Set the default message-kind for output received from postprocess-script 
# (None, Detail, Info, Warning, Error, Debug).
# NZBGet checks if the line written by the script to stdout or stderr starts
# with special character-sequence, determining the message-kind, e.g.:
# [INFO] bla-bla
# [DETAIL] bla-bla
# [WARNING] bla-bla
# [ERROR] bla-bla
# [DEBUG] bla-bla
# If the message-kind was detected the text is added to log with detected type.

### PERFORMANCE                                                            ###

# On a very fast connection and slow CPU and/or drive the following 
# settings may improve performance:
# 1) Disable par-checking and -repairing ("ParCheck=no"). VERY important,
#    because par-checking/repairing needs a lot of CPU-power and 
#    significantly increases disk usage;
# 2) Try to activate option "DirectWrite" ("DirectWrite=yes");
# 3) Disable option "CrcCheck" ("CrcCheck=no");
# 4) Disable option "ContinuePartial" ("ContinuePartial=no");
# 5) Do not limit download rate ("DownloadRate=0"), because the bandwidth 
#    throttling eats CPU time;
# 6) Disable logging for info- and debug-messages ("InfoTarget=none", 
#    "DebugTarget=none");
# 7) Run the program in daemon (Posix) or service (Windows) mode and use
#    remote client for short periods of time needed for controlling of 
#    download process on server. Daemon/Service mode eats less CPU 
#    resources due to not updating of output on screen.
# 8) Increase the value of option "WriteBufferSize" or better set it to 
#    "-1" (max/auto) if you have spare 5-20 MB of memory.
