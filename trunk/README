1. About NZBGet
=====================================

NZBGet is a binary newsgrabber, which downloads files from usenet
based on information given in nzb-files. NZBGet can be used in
standalone and in server/client modes. In standalone mode you 
pass a nzb-file as parameter in command-line, NZBGet downloads
listed files and then exits. 

In server/client mode NZBGet runs as server in background.
Then you use client to send requests to server. The sample requests
are: download nzb-file, list files in queue, etc.

Standalone-tool, server and client are all contained in only one 
executable file "nzbget". The mode in which the program works 
depends on command-line parameters passed to the program.

=====================================
2. Supported OS
=====================================

NZBGet is written in C++ and was initialy developed on Linux.
It was ported to Windows later and tested for compatibility with
several POSIX-OS'es.

The current version (0.3.1) should run at least on:
  - Linux Debian 4.0 on x86;
  - Linux BusyBox with uClibc on MIPSEL;
  - PC-BSD 1.4 (based on FreeBSD 6.2) on x86;
  - Windows XP SP2 on x86.

The previous version (0.3.0) was also tested on:
  - Linux Debian 3.1 on x86;
  - Solaris 10 on x86;
  - Linux Debian 3.1 on SPARC (QEmu).

Clients and servers running on different OS'es may communicate with
each other. For example, you can use NZBGet as client on Windows to 
control your NZBGet-server running on Linux.

The download-section of NZBGet web-site provides binary files
for Windows. The binary packages for many routers and NAS devices are 
also available in OPTWARE repository (http://www.nslu2-linux.org), 
but for most POSIX-systems you need to compile the program yourself. 

If you have downloaded binaries you can just jump to section 
"Configuration".

=====================================
3. Prerequisites on POSIX
=====================================

NZBGet is developed on a linux-system, but it should run on other
POSIX platforms (see the list of tested platforms above).

NZBGet absolutely needs the following libraries:

 - libstdc++     (usually part of compiler)
 - libxml2       (http://www.xmlsoft.org)

And the following libraries are optional:

 - for curses-output-mode (enabled by default):
   - libcurses   (usually part of commercial systems)
     or (better)
   - libncurses  (http://invisible-island.net/ncurses)
   
 - for par-check and -repair (enabled by default):
   - libpar2     (http://parchive.sourceforge.net)
   - libsigc++   (http://libsigc.sourceforge.net)

 - for support of encoding-formats other than yEnc (disabled by default):
   - libuu       (http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview)

All these libraries are included in modern Linux distributions and
should be available as installable packages. Please note that you also 
need the developer packages for these libraries too, they package names 
have often suffix "dev" or "devel". On other systems you may need to 
download the libraries at the given URLs and compile them (see hints below).


=====================================
4. Installation on POSIX
=====================================

Well, the usual stuff:

 - untar the nzbget-source via
     tar -zxf nzbget-VERSION.tar.gz
 - change into nzbget-directory via
     cd nzbget-VERSION
 - configure it via
     ./configure
   (maybe you have to tell configure, where to find some libraries.
       ./configure --help is your friend! ;-)
    also see "Configure-options" later.)
 - compile it via
     make
   (you may get some warnings concerning 'mktemp', simply ignore them!)
 - become root via
     su
 - install it via
     make install

Configure-options
-----------------
You may run configure with additional arguments:

  --enable-uulib - to make with uulib-library, in a case you want it
    (see later section "Optional package: uulib"). This option is not
    enabled by default.
    
  --disable-curses - to make without curses-support. Use this option
    if you can not use curses/ncurses.
    
  --disable-parcheck - to make without parcheck-support. Use this option
    if you can not use libpar2 or libsigc++.
       
  --enable-debug - to build in debug-mode, if you want to see and log
    debug-messages.

Optional package: uulib
-----------------------
uulib is not required to compile and run nzbget, because nzbget includes
internal decoder for yEnc-format. However, uulib supports many other formats,
you may possibly want to have support for. In this case you can build the
program with uulib-support enabled.

NOTE: enabling uulib does not disable internal decoder. The program built with
uulib-support can use both decoders (internal and uulib), depending on option
"decoder" in program's configuration file.

To build with uulib use option "--enable-uulib" while running configure:
  
  ./configure --enable-uulib

The uulib must be installed on your system. On most linux distributions 
the package uulib-dev is available. So you only need to install this package
and run configure with parameter "--enable-uulib".
If you do not have this package you can compile uulib yourself:
  
  - download source code of uudeview from 
    http://www.fpx.de/fp/Software/UUDeview;
  - build uudeview as usually:
      /.confugure
      make
  - start nzbget's configure-script with following parameters:
      ./configure --enable-uulib \
         --with-uulib-includes=<path to uudeview>/uulib \
         --with-uulib-libraries=<path to uudeview>/uulib
    for example:
      ./configure --enable-uulib \
         --with-uulib-includes=/home/user/uudeview-0.5.20/uulib \
         --with-uulib-libraries=/home/user/uudeview-0.5.20/uulib
  - now you can compile nzbget.

NOTE: after nzbget is compiled, the code of uulib-library is built into
nzbget's executable. You do not need to have uulib on target system
to run nzbget.

Optional package: par-check
---------------------------
NZBGet can check and repair downloaded files for you. For this purpose
it uses library par2 (libpar2), which needs sigc++ on its part.

To build with par-check use option "--enable-parcheck" while running 
configure:
  
  ./configure --enable-parcheck

The libpar2 and libsigc++ (version 2 or later) must be installed on your
system. On most linux distributions these libraries are available as packages.
So you only need to install theme and run configure with parameter
"--enable-parcheck".
If you do not have these package you can compile them yourself. Please
refer to section "Optional package: uulib" for an example on how to
compile additional library. Following configure-parameters may be usefull:

  --with-libpar2-includes
  --with-libpar2-libraries
  --with-libsigc-includes
  --with-libsigc-libraries
  
The library libsigc++ must be installed first, since libpar2 requires it.

Optional package: curses
-------------------------
For curses-outputmode you need ncurses or curses on your system.
If you do not have one of them you can download and compile ncurses yourself.
Please refer to section "Optional package: uulib" for an example on how to
compile additional library. Following configure-parameters may be usefull:

  --with-libcurses-includes
  --with-libcurses-libraries

If you are not able to use curses or ncurses or do not want them you can
make the program without support for curses using option "--disable-curses":

  ./configure --disable-curses

=====================================
5. Compiling on Windows
=====================================

NZBGet is developed using MS Visual C++ 2005. The project file and solution 
are provided. If you use MS Visual C++ 2005 Express you need to download
and install Platform SDK.

To compile the program with par-check-support you also need the following 
libraries:

   - libsigc++   (http://libsigc.sourceforge.net)
   - libpar2     (http://parchive.sourceforge.net)
   
Download these libaries, then use patch-files provided with NZBGet to create
preconfigured project files and solutions for each library. 
Look at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm for info on how
to use patch-files, if you do not familiar with this technique.

After libsigc++ and libpar2 are compiled in static libraries (.lib) 
and include- and libraries-paths are configured in MS Visual C++ 2005 you
should be able to compile NZBGet.   

=====================================
6. Configuration
=====================================

NZBGet needs a configuration-file to work properly. 

You need to set at least the option "MAINDIR" and one newsserver in
configuration file. Have a look at the example in nzbget.conf.example, 
it has comments on how to use each option.

The program looks for configuration file in following standard 
locations (in this order):

On POSIX systems:

  ~/.nzbget
  /etc/nzbget.conf
  /usr/etc/nzbget.conf
  /usr/local/etc/nzbget.conf
  /opt/etc/nzbget.conf
  
On Windows:
  <EXE-DIR>\nzbget.conf

If you put the configuration file in other place, you can use command-
line switch "-c <filename>" to point the program to correct location.

In special cases you can run program without configuration file using
switch "-n". You need to use switch "-o" to pass required configuration 
options via command-line.

=====================================
7. Usage
=====================================

NZBGet can be used in either standalone mode which downloads a single file 
or as a server which is able to queue up numerous download requests.

Standalone mode:
----------------

nzbget <nzb-file>

Server mode:
------------

First start the nzbget-server:

  - in console mode:

	nzbget -s
	
  - or in daemon mode (POSIX only):

	nzbget -D
	
	- or as a service (Windowx only, firstly install the service with command
	  "nzbget -install"):

  net start NZBGet
  
To stop server use:

  nzbget -Q  

Depending on which frontend has been selected in the nzbget.conf file
(option "outputmode") the server should display a message that
it is ready to receive download requests (this applies only to console
mode, not to daemon mode).

When the server is running it is possible to queue up downloads. This can be
done either in terminal with "nzbget -A <nzb-file>" or by uploading
a nzb-file into server's monitor-directory (<MAINDIR>/nzb by default).

To check the status of server start client and connect it to server:
  
  nzbget -C

The client have three different (display) outputmodes, which you can select
in configuration file (on client computer) or in command line. Try them:

  nzbget -o outputmode=log -C

  nzbget -o outputmode=color -C

  nzbget -o outputmode=curses -C

To list files in server's queue:

  nzbget -L
  
It prints something like:

  [1] nzbname\filename1.rar (50.00 MB)
  [2] nzbname\filename1.r01 (50.00 MB)

The numbers in square braces are ID's of files in queue. They can be used
in edit-command. For example to move file with ID 2 to the top of queue:

  nzbget -E T 2
  
or to pause files with IDs from 10 to 20:

  nzbget -E P 10-20

or to delete files from queue:

  nzbget -E D 3 10-15 20-21 16

The edit-command has also a group-mode which affects all files from the
same nzb-request. You need to pass one ID of any file in the group. For
example to delete all files from the first nzb-request:

  nzbget -E G D 1

The switch "o" is useful to override options in configuration files. 
For example:

  nzbget -o reloadqueue=no -o dupecheck=no -o parcheck=yes -s
  
or:

  nzbget -o createlog=no -C
  
Running client & server on seperate machines:
---------------------------------------------

Since nzbget communicates via TCP/IP it's possible to have a server running on
one computer and adding downloads via a client on another computer.

Do this by setting the "serverip" option in the nzbget.conf file to point to the
IP of the server (default is localhost which means client and server runs on 
same computer)

Security warning
----------------

NZBGet communicates via unsecured socket connections. This makes it vulnerable.
Although server checks the password passed by client, this password is still 
transmitted in unsecured way. For this reason it is highly recommended 
to configure your Firewall to not expose the port used by NZBGet to WAN. 

If you need to control server from WAN it is better to connect to server's
terminal via SSH (POSIX) or remote desktop (Windows) and then run
nzbget-client-commands in this terminal.
